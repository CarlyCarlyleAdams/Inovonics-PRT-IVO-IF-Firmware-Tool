echo Firmware Update Tool for PRT-IVO-IF
echo.
echo ******************************************************************************
echo If you need to update this tool for a different Inovonics firmware version.
echo Then make a copy of the firmware file and rename it to the following... 
echo from e.g. 
echo PRT_IVO_IF_App_hw_208_5150_000_ver_1_00_bd_026_r_J057.bin
echo to
echo PRT_IVO_IF.bin
echo This PRT_IVO_IF.bin file must be in the same folder as the RUN THIS.bat file.
echo ******************************************************************************
echo.
echo NOW TO START UPDATING THE FIRMWARE!
echo.
echo Plug directly into the Inovonics modules ethernet port and Web browse to it.
echo The default settings 
echo IP Address - 192.168.1.3
echo Username - admin
echo Password - admin
echo.
echo First, note the Firmware/App Version 
echo  so you can see if it got updated at the end when logging back in.
echo If the update worked but the version did not change
echo  then the unit may already be on the same version as this tool.
echo.
echo Then, put it into boot mode.
echo This is done from the device tab at the at the bottom (Click "here" to enter boot mode)
echo Do that now!
